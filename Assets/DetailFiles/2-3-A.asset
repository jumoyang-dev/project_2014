  description: "<color=#ff0000ff>Telegram 306.18.36:</color>\n\r\nTo Your Glory:\r\n\r\nDespite
    the fact that Station Sixteen has been allocated 5% more resources, the general
    Proles populace is still unsatisfied with the amount of food and water they have.
    Upon learning the fact that Station Sixteen has been given more resources, Station
    Seventeen is displaying potential tendency toward a possible uprising in the
    near future for similar distribution of food. \r\n\r\nThis telegram is intended
    to inform Your Glory of Ryan Arnold, the administrator of Station Sixteen, who
    has been recently found returning to Airstrip One without any given notice. \r\n\r\nGiven
    the fact that the unseen uprising occurring at Station Sixteen has never happened
    in any other Stations nor Airstrips, we believe in the possibility that the behavior
    is closely related to the influence of the New Brotherhood. Actions on Station
    Sixteen and Arnold are recommended below.\r\n"
