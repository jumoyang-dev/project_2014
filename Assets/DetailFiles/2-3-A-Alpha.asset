  description: "In Assistance to Your Glory\u2019s Decision:\r\n\r\nAlthough the
    current situation at Station Sixteen is potentially threatening in terms of sustaining
    local control, we believe that the urgent matter at hand is to investigate Arnold,
    who has been reported to be expressing unnecessary hospitality to the local Proles.
    This behavior is suspicious and needs to be addressed as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWe
    suggest that Arnold be sent to the thought police at the Quarters, and we continue
    to observe the behavior of the people at Station Sixteen.\r\n"
