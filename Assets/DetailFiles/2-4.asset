  description: "<color=#ff0000ff>Priority: MEDIUM\r\nCONFIDENTIAL CODE: 11101\r </color>\nTo
    Your Glory:\r\n\r\nDespite the various quality and performance checks of The
    Device prior to its launch and all of its updates, we have recently discovered
    that The Device could be used to access a hidden connection that we term as \u201CThe
    Hind\u201D. It is a connection not normally connectable if we use The Device
    normally. We were able to discover the existence of it through a glitch of one
    Party Member\u2019s Device but were also quickly rejected from continuing the
    connection. \r\n\r\nDuring the brief minute of connection that we were able to
    have, we noticed that The Hind might possess information that should not be stored,
    discussed, nor displayed on any of The Device\u2019s connections.\r\n\r\nFurther
    investigation will be conducted regarding this matter.\r\n\r\n[PLEASE DESTROY
    UPON REVIEWING]\r\n"
