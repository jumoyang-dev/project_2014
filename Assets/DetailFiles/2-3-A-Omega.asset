  description: "In Assistance to Your Glory\u2019s Decision:\r\n\r\nBased on the
    current situation, we suggest that Station Sixteen be eliminated immediately
    with the deployment of a nuclear bomb to achieve mass releasing of the local
    Proles populace, including the jurisdiction office, which has potentially been
    infiltrated by and involved with the New Brotherhood. \r\nRyan Arnold, who has
    returned to Airstrip One without prior notice, is displaying suspicious behavior
    that should be treated as a sufficient reason for an immediate execution to eliminate
    further threats from the New Brotherhood.\r\n"
