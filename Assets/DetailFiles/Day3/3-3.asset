  description: "To Your Glory:\r\n\r\nBased on the result of our last check-in, I
    believe that Your Glory\u2019s condition is deteriorating at a much faster speed
    than we had expected. After a thorough discussion with Mr.Stewart, the Head Administrator
    at the <link=\"id_06\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Ministry of Peace</link></color></u>,
    he believed that to also comply with Your Glory\u2019s intention to act on all
    executive decisions, it is necessary to increase the dose of Your Glory\u2019s
    medications to double the amount than before. \r\n\r\nThe medications shall be
    delivered to Your Glory shortly.\r\n"
