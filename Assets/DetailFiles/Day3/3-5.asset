  description: "\nTo Your Glory:\r\n\r\nUpon further investigation in the hidden
    connection termed as \u201CThe Hind\u201D, we have come to the realization that
    The Hind is the New Brotherhood\u2019s primary method of attracting potential
    thought criminals to their collective. \nIt is also believed that \u201CThe Hind\u201D
    did not occur from accidental glitches of the entire Device system, but through
    intentional implementation from vile individuals who are capable of breaching
    through the Device\u2019s strong security protection. \r\nWe shall communicate
    with Mr.Darwin Stewart, the designer of the Device system, to find the solution
    to this urgent matter.\r\n[PLEASE DESTROY UPON REVIEWING]\r\n"
