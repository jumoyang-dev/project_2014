  description: "Priority: MEDIUM\r\nCONFIDENTIAL CODE: 11101\r\n\r\nTo Your Glory:\r\n\r\nUpon
    further investigation in the hidden connection termed as \u201CThe Hind\u201D,
    we have come to the realization that The Hind is the New Brotherhood\u2019s primary
    method of attracting potential thought criminals to their collective. The Hind
    possesses complete digital communications through which individuals could \u201Ctalk\u201D
    to each other at real-time, creating suspicious back-and-forth interactions.
    \r\nIt is also believed that \u201CThe Hind\u201D did not occur from accidental
    glitches of the entire <link=\"id_12\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Device</link></color></u>
    system, but through intentional implementation of vile individuals who are capable
    of breaching through the <link=\"id_12\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Device</link></color></u>\u2019s
    strong security protection. \r\nAs of now, we are unable to find a path to shut
    down The Hind and the service provided, we shall communicate with Mr.Darwin Stewart,
    the designer of the <link=\"id_12\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Device</link></color></u>
    system, to find the solution to this urgent matter.\r\n[PLEASE DESTROY UPON REVIEWING]\r\n"
