  description: "In assistance to Your Glory\u2019s decision:\r\n\r\nAlthough reassigning
    the extra members of Love to assist with the construction of the new Outer Party
    homes seems reasonable, the members of Love, who are genetically less capable
    of performing high intensity physical labors, will pose a great threat to the
    quality of the construction. For the fact that the current <link=\"id_05\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Ministry
    of Love</link></color></u> at <link=\"id_09\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Airstrip</link></color></u>
    Nine does not require additional forces, the extra members of Love should be
    mass released as they are potentially useless as of now. The construction of
    the Outer Party homes could use assistance from other <link=\"id_09\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Airstrip</link></color></u>s
    or <link=\"id_10\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Station</link></color></u>s to ensure
    stability and quality.\r\nPlease review and sign if Your Glory\u2019s consent
    is given.\r\n"
