    Your Glory:\r\n\tAs Your Glory have been informed before, the Brotherhood, originally
    a false construct designed to capture potential thought criminals in the name
    of revolution, has become an actualized threat in the past three years, transforming
    into a potential rebellious collective, aiming to cause irreversible damage to
    the achievement of IngSoc and Your Glory. \r\n\tUpon discovering the New Brotherhood\u2019s
    possible incorporation of the Proles populace, we have successfully gathered
    information that the defection of the New Brotherhood is closely connected to
    an individual with a code name adopted by the collective: \r\nThe Iron Fist.\r\n\tOperation
    Iron Fist has been established to begin tracking down this individual and possible
    connections.\r\n[PLEASE DESTROY UPON REVIEWING]\n"
