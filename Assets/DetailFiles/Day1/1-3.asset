  description: "\r\nTo Your Glory:\r\n\r\nAs Your Glory have been informed before,
    the Brotherhood, originally a false construct designed to capture potential thought
    criminals in the name of revolution, has become an actualized threat in the past
    three years, transforming into a potential rebellious collective, aiming to cause
    irreversible damage to the achievement of IngSoc Party and Your Glory. \r\n\tWe
    have successfully gathered information that the defection of the New Brotherhood
    is closely connected to an individual with a code name adopted by the collective:
    \r\nThe Iron Fist.\r\n\tOperation Iron Fist has been established to begin tracking
    down this individual and possible connections.\r"
