  description: "CLASSIFIED:\r\nPriority: TOP\r\nCONFIDENTIAL CODE: 11100\r\n\r\nTo
    Your Glory:\r\n\r\nAs Your Glory have been informed before, the Brotherhood,
    originally a false construct designed to capture potential thought criminals
    in the name of revolution, has become an actualized threat in the past three
    years, transforming into a potential rebellious collective, aiming to cause irreversible
    damage to the achievement of IngSoc and Your Glory. \r\n\r\n\tUpon discovering
    the New Brotherhood\u2019s possible incorporation of the Proles populace, we
    have successfully gathered information that the defection of the New Brotherhood
    is closely connected to an individual with a code name adopted by the collective:
    \r\n\r\nThe Iron Fist.\r\n\r\n\tOperation Iron Fist has been established to begin
    tracking down this individual and possible connections.\r\n"
