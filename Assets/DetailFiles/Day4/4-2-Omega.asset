  description: "In assistance to Your Glory\u2019s decision:\r\n\r\nThe Omega team
    iss designed to balance the options provided by the Alpha team. Upon reviewing
    the Alpha version of the proposal, we believe that such a plan is both inappropriate
    and suspicious. For decades during which no actual evidence of collective rebellion
    was found, this outbreak poses the greatest threat as the terroristic Brotherhood
    utilizes the <link=\"id_11\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>proles</link></color></u>, making
    up 78% of the entire population, as their main source of manpower. \r\nProposing
    a plan which advocates for the delay of handling the situation, the Alpha team
    has possibly been infiltrated by influences from the New Brotherhood. Combining
    with the recent discovery of The Hinge, we believe that Alpha Strategy Team No.3
    should be sentenced to the <link=\"id_05\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Ministry of Love</link></color></u>
    immediately for questioning. \r\nPlease review and sign if Your Glory\u2019s
    consent is given to proceed.\r\n"
