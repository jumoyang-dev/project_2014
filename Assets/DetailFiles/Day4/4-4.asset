  description: "Father,\r\n\r\nI have not contacted you for a while like this. Doctor
    Thompson has informed me regarding your condition. Even with the increased dose,
    based on your last check-in, I do see that your condition is still worsening.
    Communicating with you not as The General of <link=\"id_06\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Ministry
    of Peace</link></color></u>, but as your son Darwin, I am deeply concerned that
    continuing to work will further damage your health. If you wish to have some
    rest and a reduced workload, I could assist you in handling your daily agenda.
    I am also working on another machine that could essentially help with processing
    documents based on your preferences. \r\nPlease remember to eat and take your
    medication on time. \r\n"
