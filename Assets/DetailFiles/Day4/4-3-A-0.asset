  description: "To Your Glory:\r\n\r\nThe <link=\"id_13\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Septa</link></color></u>
    test that has been conducted over the last 19 days on subject Michael Freeman
    has provided significant results. \r\nThe subject reached Near Death states 3
    times with an average 1.4% of Mental Stimulation. \r\nThe subject reached Near
    Death states 7 times with an average 0.6% of Physical Stimulation.\r\nThe adjustment
    of the threshold has been performed by the <link=\"id_13\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Septa</link></color></u>
    Machine under the \u201CNo Death\u201D condition, achieving spontaneous results.
    \r\nThe subject provided more information that was never obtained before with
    conventional questioning methods.\r\nSuch information is of unimportant value
    for being largely related to the subject\u2019s personal matters, which is not
    within our concern. \r\nYour Glory\u2019s consent is required to perform testing
    on the subject without the \u201CNo Death\u201D condition, as the subject is
    no longer of any use.\r\nPlease advise.\r\n"
