  description: "<color=#ff0000ff>Telegram 306.18.36:</color>\n\r\nTo Your Glory:\r\n\r\nWith
    the bombing and massive releasing of Station Sixteen, we have deemd it that the
    Station is no longer habitable and should display no signs of life remaining.
    \r\nHowever, Ryan Arnold, the local jurisdiction administrator, has obtained
    information regarding the bombing prior to the event taking place, and has secretly
    fled back to Airstrip One.\r\nCapturing Arnold is only a matter of time. We request
    your decision regarding the disposal of Arnold. \r\nPlease review the proposals
    below and advise.\r\n"
