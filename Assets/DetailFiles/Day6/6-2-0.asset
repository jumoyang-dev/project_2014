  description: "To Your Glory:\r\n\r\nThis telegram serves to inform Your Glory of
    the fall of <link=\"id_09\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Airstrip</link></color></u> Five
    to the hands of the New Brotherhood. Since the beginning of the <link=\"id_10\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Station</link></color></u>
    Seventeen breakout, <link=\"id_09\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Airstrip</link></color></u>
    Five has been the 9th territory to be plundered by the terrorist collective.
    In all of the cases, members of the Party who did not oblige with the governance
    of the New Brotherhood had all been executed brutally. All security forces have
    been assigned to ensure maximum security of individual territory\u2019s Houses
    of the Inner Party. To prevent the possibility that <link=\"id_11\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>proles</link></color></u>
    of other territories have been assimilated by the New Brotherhood, we hereby
    request the activation of the SKY protocol in which all Inner Party Houses enter
    Floating Mode.\r\n\r\nPlease advise.\r\n"
