  description: "In assistance to Your Glory\u2019s decision:\r\n\r\nWhile Darwin
    Stewart\u2019s direct relationship to the former <link=\"id_06\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Ministry
    of Peace</link></color></u> and the facts mentioned in General O\u2019Connor\u2019s
    telegram could be seen as hints through which deductions could be made, we do
    believe that Stewart\u2019s continuous contribution to the development of <link=\"id_01\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Oceania</link></color></u>
    in the past decade is a stronger evidence of the individual\u2019s loyalty to
    the Party. \r\nOn the other hand, General O\u2019Connor\u2019s continuous suggestion
    of Stewart\u2019s betrayal to the Party, and the Alpha Team\u2019s proposal to
    immediately execute Stewart, which is extremely radical compared to their usual
    proposals, are analyzed as suspicious behaviors. \r\nAs a result, we suggest
    the removal of O\u2019Connor and Alpha Team No.1 for their questionable suggestions.\r\n"
