  description: "To Your Glory:\r\n\r\nThe assimilation of the former <link=\"id_06\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Ministry
    of Peace</link></color></u> with the <link=\"id_05\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Ministry
    of Love</link></color></u> has been handled in an elegant manner. All criminals
    who were involved with the development of The Hinge, the primary cause of the
    increase in the New Brotherhood\u2019s influence within the Party, have been
    executed. \r\nRegarding General Darwin Stewart, the Chair of the former <link=\"id_05\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Ministry
    of Love</link></color></u>, although he willingly suggested his own questioning
    to be done with the <link=\"id_13\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Septa</link></color></u>
    Machine, with a total of 17 \u201CNear Death\u201D states reached, we were still
    unable to identify if Stewart is indeed the Iron Fist. \r\nHowever, again citing
    the incident on March 30th that had either killed or disabled all of the 20 participants
    of the second <link=\"id_13\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Septa</link></color></u> test,
    most of whom were of immense importance to the Party, we still suggest the execution
    of Stewart as the only method of punishment. \r\nPlease advise. \r\n"
