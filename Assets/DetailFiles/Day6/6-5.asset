  description: "In Assistance to Your Glory\u2019s Decision:\r\n\r\nAs the local
    office has failed to exert control over the proles populace, on top of the proles
    essential unnecessity to benefitting the overall social construct, it is deemed
    feasible to permanently terminate the turmoil caused within Station Sixteen through
    the measure of massive releasing. Station Sixteen onward could be decreased in
    priority to focus on other stations. The jurisdiction and its administrator,
    Ryan Arnold, should be released along with the Proles for their incapability
    to exert control over the region.\r\nStation Sixteen will be removed from the
    World Map and any form of documentation recording its existence will also be
    destroyed upon the commencement of the proposed action.\r\n"
