  description: "\n\r\nTo Your Glory:\r\n\r\nAs much as we wish to continue our investigation
    regarding The Hind, the person behind the scene that is in charge of The Hind,
    presumably The Iron Fist, has forbidden any communication and access to it. However,
    prior to being restricted from establishing connections, we were able to see
    what appears to be the most recent announcement from The Iron Fist with the following
    headline:\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION IS CONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n\u2014Next one is <link=\"id_09\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Airstrip</link></color></u>
    Ten.\r\n\r\nConsidering the grave nature of this issue, we have proposed two
    options to handle The Hind immediately. \r\n\r\nPlease review and advise.\r\n"
