  description: "To Your Glory:\r\n\r\nDespite the focus on the establishment of <link=\"id_10\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Station</link></color></u>
    Twenty, we received reports from the dispatched military force that NB-14 Fluval
    missile, designed originally in October, 2013, has been put in use by the opposing
    local <link=\"id_11\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>proles</link></color></u> during a
    recent combat. \r\nThe launch of NB-14 Fluval eliminated more than half of the
    camps based in the area, declaring the defeat of the dispatched military force.
    \r\nUnless further troops are assigned to the area, the goal to establish <link=\"id_10\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Station</link></color></u>
    Twenty has fundamentally failed. \r\nWhile bombing the designated area is necessary
    for retaliation, the source from which the alien <link=\"id_11\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>proles</link></color></u>
    obtained the Oceanian missile has the higher priority in order to identify if
    potential criminals are spies or traitors are hiding in the <link=\"id_06\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Ministry
    of Peace</link></color></u>.\r\n\r\nPlease advise.\r\n"
