  description: "In assistance to Your Glory\u2019s decision: \r\n\r\nAs much as <link=\"id_09\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Airstrip</link></color></u>
    Ten has been a long-established area that is of significant value to <link=\"id_01\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Oceania</link></color></u>,
    we believe that the resources available at the area could still be obtained from
    <link=\"id_09\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Airstrip</link></color></u> Six and <link=\"id_10\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Station</link></color></u>
    Two. As a result, for the fact that <link=\"id_09\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Airstrip</link></color></u>
    Ten only contains 59,532 Party members, if the New Brotherhood intends to create
    another outbreak at the location, it is advised that preparation for the deployment
    of a bomb is necessary to eliminate all threats to the Party and affiliations
    to the New Brotherhood. \r\nIn the meantime, the \u201CSelf-destroy\u201D function
    should be turned on globally for all <link=\"id_12\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Device</link></color></u>s,
    including all cellular towers responsible for establishing connections.\r\nPlease
    review and sign if Your Glory\u2019s consent is given to proceed.\r\n"
