  description: "In assistance to Your Glory\u2019s decision:\r\n\r\nAlthough the
    capturing and questioning of influential leaders among the <link=\"id_11\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>proles</link></color></u>
    is a feasible option, it is more necessary and also efficient to investigate
    from our inside by questioning party members within the <link=\"id_06\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Ministry
    of Peace</link></color></u> who are involved in the entire task to build <link=\"id_10\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Station</link></color></u>
    Twenty. The bombing of <link=\"id_10\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Station</link></color></u>
    Seventeen should be commenced immediately as to eliminate further threats from
    the area. <link=\"id_10\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Station</link></color></u> Seventeen
    will be removed from the World Map and any form of documentation recording its
    existence will also be destroyed upon the commencement of the proposed action.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease
    review and sign if Your Glory\u2019s consent is given to proceed.\r\n"
