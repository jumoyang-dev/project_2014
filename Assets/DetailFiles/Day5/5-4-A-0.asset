  description: "Priority: HIGH\r\nCONFIDENTIAL CODE: 11101\r\nYour Glory:\r\n\r\nHere
    is a list of things that we have noticed based on our investigation and observation
    of General Stewart in the past week:\r\n\r\n1. Members of other Ministries are
    essentially forbidden to enter any premises owned, directed by, or related to
    the <link=\"id_06\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Ministry of Peace</link></color></u>.
    \r\n2. Based on close contacts who have connections with the cronies of the General
    himself, even his trusted ones have been unable to reach or see him recently.
    \r\n3. All inquiries regarding The Hinge have been left unresolved as no response
    has been received.\r\n\r\nI hereby request Your Glory\u2019s permission for members
    of the <link=\"id_05\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Ministry of Love</link></color></u>
    to enter all premises related to the <link=\"id_06\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Ministry
    of Peace</link></color></u> for full investigation.\r\n"
