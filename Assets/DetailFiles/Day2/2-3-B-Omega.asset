  description: "In assistance to Your Glory\u2019s decision:\r\n\r\nBased on the
    poor performance of Arnold in terms of being unable to sustain control during
    his term at <link=\"id_10\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Station</link></color></u> Sixteen,
    we suggest the execution of Arnold through conventional methods adopted at the
    <link=\"id_05\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Ministry of Love</link></color></u>. As a
    failure, Arnold should not take use of further resources that are valuable to
    the rest of Inner Party members.\r\n"
