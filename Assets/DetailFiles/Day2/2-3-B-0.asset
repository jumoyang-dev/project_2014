  description: "To Your Glory:\r\n\r\nWith the bombing and massive releasing of <link=\"id_10\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Station</link></color></u>
    Sixteen, we have deemed it that the <link=\"id_10\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Station</link></color></u>
    is no longer habitable and should display no signs of life remaining. \r\nHowever,
    Ryan Arnold, the local jurisdiction administrator, has obtained information regarding
    the bombing prior to the event taking place, and has secretly fled back to <link=\"id_09\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Airstrip</link></color></u>
    One.\r\nCapturing Arnold is only a matter of time. We request your decision regarding
    the disposal of Arnold. \r\nPlease review the proposals below and advise.\r\n"
