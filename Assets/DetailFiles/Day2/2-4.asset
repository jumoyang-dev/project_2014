  description: "Priority: MEDIUM\r\nCONFIDENTIAL CODE: 11101\r\n\r\nTo Your Glory:\r\n\r\nDespite
    the various quality and performance checks of The <link=\"id_12\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Device</link></color></u>
    prior to its launch and all of its updates, we have recently discovered that
    The <link=\"id_12\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Device</link></color></u> could be used
    to access a hidden connection that we term as \u201CThe Hind\u201D. It is a connection
    not normally connectable if we use The <link=\"id_12\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Device</link></color></u>
    normally. We were able to discover the existence of it through a glitch of one
    Party Member\u2019s <link=\"id_12\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Device</link></color></u>
    but were also quickly rejected from continuing the connection. \r\n\r\nDuring
    the brief minute of connection that we were able to have, we noticed that The
    Hind might possess information that should not be stored, discussed, nor displayed
    on any of The <link=\"id_12\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Device</link></color></u>\u2019s
    connections.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation will be conducted regarding this matter.\r\n\r\n[PLEASE
    DESTROY UPON REVIEWING]\r\n"
