  description: "\nTo Your Glory:\r\n\r\nWe have recently discovered that the <link=\"id_12\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Device</link></color></u>
    could be used to access a hidden connection that we term as \u201CThe Hind\u201D.
    We were able to discover the existence of it through a glitch of one Party Member\u2019s
    Device but were also quickly rejected from continuing the connection. \r\n\r\nDuring
    the brief minute of connection that we were able to have, we noticed that The
    Hind might possess information that should not be stored, discussed, nor displayed
    on any of The Device\u2019s connections.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation will be
    conducted regarding this matter.\r"
