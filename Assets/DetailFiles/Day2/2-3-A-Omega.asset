    current situation, we suggest that <link=\"id_10\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Station</link></color></u>
    Sixteen be eliminated immediately with the deployment of a nuclear bomb to achieve
    mass xecution of the local <link=\"id_11\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Proles</link></color></u>
    populace, including the jurisdiction office, which has potentially been infiltrated
    by and involved with the New Brotherhood. \r\nRyan Arnold, who has returned to
    <link=\"id_09\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Airstrip</link></color></u> One without prior
    notice, is displaying suspicious behavior that should be treated as a sufficient
    reason for an immediate execution to eliminate further threats from the New Brotherhood.\r\n"
