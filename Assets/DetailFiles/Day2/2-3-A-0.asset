  description: "\nTo Your Glory:\r\n\r\n\tRyan Arnold, the administrator of Station
    Sixteen, who has been recently found returning to <link=\"id_09\"><color=#a52a2aff><u>Airstrip</link></color></u>
    One without any given notice. \r\n\r\nGiven the fact that the unseen uprising
    occurring at Station Sixteen has never happened in any other Station nor Airstrips,
    we believe in the possibility that the behavior is closely related to the influence
    of the New Brotherhood. Actions on Station Sixteen and Arnold are recommended
    below.\r\n"
